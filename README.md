# ServeMe System(SMS)

TODO: add a logo and some bandges.
ServeMe System helps users **initiate “service request” for their home or small business**. This will help users (i.e. customers that require service) to be put in contact with service providers. You will make money by collecting commission from each service request fulfilled by the service provider. The categories of services (displayed graphically by an icon) can be expanded to cover more service areas in the future.

## Components

### Login & Registration

Customers (i.e. Service Requesters) can optionally register and login to the system. They can also order place a Service Request (SR) without registration and login.  If they choose to register and login, they could get points, can review Service Providers quality of Service, could get discounts, and receive helpful tips and updates. To register, they must provide full name, email, and phone number.

### Setup

- Sounds on/off
- Receive communication yes/no
- TODO:???use points toward a service yes/no
- Feel free to include other parameters
- TODO:???The Bold charters will be the default.

### Service Categories

## Agile organization and activities
Agile organization and activities:
Each team consists of 7 members with revolving roles as follows:
- We will use Scrum methodology in this class. Each increment (i.e. sprint) in scrum could be 2 to 4 weeks. Please pick 2 weeks for your sprints.
- Project is divided into a number of increments, i.e. Sprints, each to be completed in no more than 2 weeks. If a story is going to take longer than 2 weeks, break it down further.
- Since the semester is finite and we will end during the first week in May, we cannot complete more than 5 sprints (5 x 2 = 10 weeks).
- For each “sprint”, one member will play the role of the “ScrumMaster and Client”, the other members will be “developers” working in pairs.
- The “Client” role includes: help identify and prioritize increments and stories, participate in writing test cases prior to starting implementation (i.e. test-first strategy), make daily builds and, most importantly
- The ScrumMaster role manages all the technical details of an increment (as well as playing the “client role”). ScrumMaster position will be rotated so all member can practice. ScrumMaster may NOT develop code.
- The “Developer” role includes: implementing the required activities including but not limited to: writing requirements, design & coding, unit testing, writing test cases, integration and testing. Developers will work in pairs at all times.
- “Pairs” will be rotating as sprints change (i.e. no two people will be paired more than once)
- “Daily Standup Meetings, DSM, also referred to as daily scrum”: Normally, all team members will present their work on a daily basis while standing. In this class, since we meet only twice a week, we will have DSM every Thursday (10 minutes per team total). 
- DSM format and structure: ScrumMaster will start the meeting, and passes the turn to pairs. ScrumMaster will summarize and end the meeting. Each member will go over:
  - What did they finish since last DSM?
  - What are they going to work on next?
  - Any issues?
- Test-first” strategy: Before any development, test cases must be written of how to test the functionality. Test cases will be discussed briefly during DSMs. The exact format of test cases will be discussed later in class. In ideal situations, Junit should be used.
- “Refactoring”: Sufficient time will be devoted to refactoring (i.e. continuous optimization and simplification) and documenting the changes due to refactoring.
